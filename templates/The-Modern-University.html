culture war that has raged on college campuses since the 1960’s has seen many
thinkers enter into the fray. The likes of Sam Harris, Johnathan Haidt, and
Jordan Peterson, commonly referred to as being members of the “Intellectual
Dark Web”, have been among the most influential in recent years. Arguably the
most outspoken and reputable of these critics is Jordan Peterson, the Canadian
psychology professor from the University of Toronto. Peterson, having had a
rather successful career within academia, with numerous citations and
fellowships at institutions like Harvard, has made the largest impact with his
statements. After all, if such a successful academic is making allegations such
as these there is surely something wrong with our educational institutions.<sup>1</sup>
There are 3 central claims made by Peterson. The first being that radicalism is
too widespread within universities. The second is that these radicals exercise
too much power within academia. And the third is that the pedagogies these
radicals uphold are authoritarian and contrary to the ideal of academic
freedom. All 3 of these claims are, as we will see, not backed up by studies
nor the work written by the scholars they attack.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>During
a debate with the philosopher Slavoj Zizek Peterson was pressed about the
claims he has made about Marxism within academia. Zizek asks him either to
explain where he got the data for these claims or to name these so-called “postmodern
neo-Marxists” that have taken over the university.<sup>2</sup> Peterson choose
the former explaining that Johnathan Haidt’s Heterodox Academy had documented
“a dearth of conservative voices within the social science and humanities.” And
that there were surveys showing that approximately 25% of social scientists in
the US identified themselves as Marxists. Yet when one tries to look for the
evidence supposedly held by Haidt’s Heterodox Academy the best article that can
be found is one title <i>Why Should We Care About Ideological Diversity in the
Academy?</i> The study cited by the author was conducted by sociologists Neil
Gross and Solon Simmons and is titled <i>The Social and Political Views of
American College and University Professors</i>. The study shows that Peterson’s
claim that 25% of social scientists identify as Marxists was a lie. Table 12 of
the study shows that only 17.6% of professors within the social sciences
identified as Marxists and the number drops down to 5% within the humanities.
However, two key points that are made by Gross and Simmons in the study and
their book <i>Professors and Their Politics</i>, which builds on the data from
the study, are never mentioned by Peterson. When discussing their figures on
Marxists in the academy, which they say indicate that self-identified Marxists
are rare in academia, they point out that:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“…it
is important to add that among both social scientists and humanists,
identification as a Marxist may signal theoretical orientation as much as
political commitment”.<sup>3</sup> </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This explains why they
find that about 27% of sociologists identify as Marxists. As Marx is regarded
as being a foundational thinker within sociology this figure should be no more
surprising than one that would indicate 30% of sociologists were Durkheimians.
The same can also be said of other social sciences and humanities disciplines
in which Marx’s work has been highly influential such as geography, philosophy
and history with Henri Lefebvre, Antonio Gramsci, and E. P. Thompson being examples
of influential Marxists in each field, respectively. The second point that is ignored
is that the researchers’ findings indicate that radicalism has seen a sharp
decline across generational lines. They write: </span></p>

"Times New Roman",serif'>“Consistent with our earlier claim that the number of
moderates in academe appears to have been on the upswing in 2006, we find that
self- described radicalism is more common among professors who came of age in
the 1960s than among younger ones, suggesting generational change. For example,
18 percent of professors aged 50–64 consider themselves liberal radicals,
compared with just 4 percent of professors aged 26– 35. Similarly, whereas 19
percent of professors aged 50– 64 consider themselves liberal activists, this
is true of only 3 percent of professors in the youngest age cohort.”<sup>4</sup>

"Times New Roman",serif'>“Relative to their presence in academia overall,
radicals are underrepresented in the youngest generation of professors in the
PAP study. This development is likely driven by two factors. First, the 1980s
and 1990s, the decades when most of these professors were enrolled in college,
were not, for a variety of reasons, times of intense left social movement
activity in American society or on American campuses, a few non- Marxian
movements notwithstanding, such as the South African divestment campaign (and
academic feminism). Few academics who came of age then—people whose adolescent
“impressionable years” occurred during the Reagan era—were therefore pulled
into a far-left orbit. Second, as sociologist Andrew Abbott has emphasized,
building on a classic contribution to sociology made by the early twentieth-
century sociologist Karl Mannheim, academic generations often engage in efforts
to distance themselves from their predecessors.”<sup>5</sup></span></p>

radicalism. For example, a Google Books ngram examining the American English

fell off sharply and are now at their lowest levels since the mid- 1950s.
“Marxist literary criticism” peaked in the 1970s too. From the perspective of
social theory anyway this is a loss: radical intellectual traditions have
historically been sources of great insight.”<sup>6</sup></span></p>

of this history that relates to the academy is partially documented in <i>Academic
Repression </i>a book authored by over two dozen academics as well as <i>The Capitalist
University</i> written by historian Henry Heller. One of the cases of
repression discussed by the authors of the former is the case of Angela Davis
who was a professor of philosophy at UCLA and an African American civil rights
activist. In 1970 Ronald Reagan, who was governor of California and head of the
Board of Regents at the time, spearheaded the charge to fire Davis from her
post on the grounds of a 1940 resolution that barred members of the communist
party from teaching at state universities. After the firing Reagan proceeded to
send a letter to all UCLA faculty in which he smugly stated: </span></p>

in his chapter on the effects of the Cold War on the humanities and social
sciences recalls the fate of the historian Herbert Aptheker who was the first
American historian to give credibility to the idea of African American
resistance to slavery. Heller explains that due to his communist party
membership and Marxist writing his work was meet with skepticism and rejection
and he was ultimately blacklisted. Heller contrasts this with the reception of
Marxist historian E. P. Thompsons work <i>The Making of the English Working
Class</i> in England which similarly explored resistance from oppressed classes
and was meet with praise. Political scientist Robert Goldstein documents more
instances of academic repression in <i>Political Repression in Modern America</i>

then goes on to detail 5 different cases of such firings as well as mentioning
that similar events took place at 6 other institutions. All of this happened
during the Vietnam War era, a time when campus radicalism and protests were at
their strongest. Similarly, in the introduction to <i>Academic Repression</i>
Steven Best and Peter McLaren list more than a dozen examples of repression of
leftists in the post-1960’s period. These instances, and countless others, of
academic repression of leftists all lead to the conclusion offered by American
historian Eric Foner, quoted by Heller, who states in an interview:       </span></p>

drew a very rigid line around what was acceptable and what was not acceptable
in politics, in art, in history, in many other areas, and the universities
played their role in the Cold War…That’s the fundamental answer.”<sup>9</sup> </span></p>

shadow of repression from the Cold War era still looms over the university to
this day as shown by the study conducted by Gross and Simmons. The authors
state that during the study, professors where asked if a colleague ever had to
give them advice on how to avoid getting into trouble at their institution for
their political views. Gross and Simmons reported that those on the far left
answered ‘yes’ with much more frequency. About 13.8% of non-Marxists answered
‘yes’ to the question but when posed to Marxists, the number more than doubled
reaching 28.6%.<sup>10</sup> This indicates that Marxist academics are still subject
to greater academic threat due to their political views than non-Marxists. As
an interesting aside, the decline in Marxism’s influence within academia can
also be said to have gone hand in hand not just with the collapse of the Soviet
bloc in 1989 and 1991 but with the rise of postcolonial theory. The later
occurred in large part due to the work of Edward Said, whose seminal work <i>Orientalism
</i>revolutionized western academic discourse around Eastern history and
culture. Heller similarly notes this by stating:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:
"Times New Roman",serif'>“As E. San [Juan Jr.]* puts it “the anti-Marxism of
postcolonial theory may be attributed partly to Said’s eclecticism, his belief
that American left criticism is marginal, and his distorted if not wholly false
understanding of Marxism based on doctrinaire anticommunism and the model of
‘actually existing socialism’ during the Cold War.”<sup>11</sup></span></p>

is very puzzling given the picture Peterson paints of the modern university.
Thus, the question now becomes: if it is not overrun by Marxists, then what
exactly are the politics of the modern university? According to Gross and
Simmons it is a mostly liberal institution, but as they say in their
conclusion: </span></p>

addition to repression based on Cold War politics, the modern university has
also been the site of repression based on Zionist politics as well. Two examples
of this would be the firing of political scientist Norman Finkelstein from
DePaul University and the firing of Steven Salaita from the University of
Illinois. In the case of Norman Finkelstein, who is a distinguished scholar
that has done rigorous work on the Israel-Palestine conflict as well as exposed
anti-Palestinian propaganda masquerading as scholarship in the case of Joan
Peters, the controversy erupted after he accused Alan Dershowitz, then
professor of law at Harvard University, of plagiarizing parts of his book <i>The
Case for Israel</i> from Peters book <i>From Time Immemorial </i>during a radio
discussion. During the discussion Finkelstein produced multiple examples of
plagiarism in Dershowitz’s book and afterwards Dershowitz wrote a letter to
DePaul University demanding that Finkelstein be denied tenure, which he was.
Another one of Finkelstein’s colleagues Mehrene Larudee, who strongly defended
him, was also denied tenure and fired despite full support from the
international studies department.  In the case of Steven Salaita, he was a
tenured professor of English at Virginia Tech until he resigned in 2014 after
accepting an offer at the University of Illinois. However before starting the
position the offer was revoked by the university chancellor who falsely
equating Salaita’s tweets criticizing the 2014 attack on Gaza by Israel with
anti-Semitism. Curiously, you never hear Peterson discuss these examples of
very recent repression. This is likely due to the fact that both of these
professors were fired <i>in spite of</i> sizable protests by students <i>and</i>
professors at their university which would contradict his implicit claim that
student activists and radical professors are the main threat to academic
freedom today. </span></p>

to overestimate the amount of power they have within the institution. The
modern university, like all social institutions, has not existed in a vacuum
but rather has developed within and been influenced by the economic and
political framework that dominates American society. Heller argues that
corporations have had far more power over universities than Peterson is willing
to admit. This can be traced as far back as the early 20<sup>th</sup> century
with the Rockefeller, Ford and Carnegie philanthropies along with other
foundations created by industrial capitalists which Heller says: </span></p>

over education policy at the national level is manifest through the activities
of the Business Higher Education Forum, whose goal is to use the institutions
of higher education to allow the United States to maintain and enhance its
competitive edge globally. Today there is evidence that the number of
university trustees connected to science-based corporations significantly
influences the amount of R&amp;D funding a university receives from government.
It seems that this is a result of the rise of an executive science network that
plays an instrumental role in relations between universities, government, and
industry, helping to shape the policies of universities in the direction of
neoliberalism.”<sup>15</sup> </span></p>

He cites the work of two scholars of the history of American higher education:
Frank Donoghue and Christopher Newfield. Heller, citing Donoghue, explains: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%;
text-autospace:none'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:

forecasts the transformation of most universities into businesses or trade
schools. The transformation will be driven by student impatience with the
restrictions of the traditional liberal arts education, with its expensive
four-year time commitment and its abstract curriculum. The transformation will
also be driven by the decline in public funding of universities. The bachelor
of arts or science degree will be superseded by a certificate certifying the
student’s qualifications for his or her future occupation. Likely the two-year
college, perhaps run for profit, will replace the traditional university. At
the same time Donoghue believes that the well-funded top universities will be
reserved for the rich and upper-middle class and will continue to offer a
liberal arts education as a mark of prestige and class status.”<sup>18</sup>   </span></p>

style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>What
is shocking about Petersons criticisms is not just their unoriginality but also
their level of rigor. Criticism of the university like his can be found as far
back as 1987 with the publication of philosopher Allan Bloom’s book <i>The
Closing of the American Mind</i>.  And after Bloom came Paul Gross and Norman
Levitt with their book <i>Higher Superstition</i> which was their attempt at a
critique of postmodern scholarship within the academy many years before
Petersons rise to fame. In <i>Academic Repression</i> philosophers and scholars
of postmodernism Steven Best and Douglas Kellner explain how little Gross and
Levitt grasp many of the claims made by postmodern thinkers they attack like
Foucault and Derrida. However, what differentiates Gross and Levitt from
Peterson is that they at least seemed to try to read and quote the philosophers
they were attacking, particularly on their positions on language. However, none
of this can be found in the critiques of Jordan Peterson. Peterson rarely, if
ever, brings up the extremely important relationship between postmodernists and
language. He instead opts to advocate that those who see the 20<sup>th</sup>
century communist regimes as perversions of Marxist theory should be “punched
in the nose”<sup>20</sup> and mock the deaths of philosophers he hasn’t made
any effort to understand.<sup>21</sup> Interestingly enough Kellner and Best do
not seek to defend postmodern positions in philosophy, they themselves say they
argue in defense of the Enlightenment project and critique the works of
thinkers such as Foucault, Deleuze and Lyotard and others in their work <i>Postmodern
Theory</i>. What they take issue with is attacking philosophers without
properly engaging with their work; a trend which has culminated into Peterson. However,
the fact that Peterson is undoubtedly the most popular critic of postmodernism
in the 21<sup>st</sup> century should be alarming to proponents and scholars of
postmodern philosophy as it signals either an inability or lack of desire to
communicate these ideas, as well as their genuine criticisms, coherently to the
general public; a failure which Peterson has clearly capitalized on. Jonathan Haidt
in his book <i>The Coddling of the American Mind </i>quotes left wing
philosopher Herbert Marcuse’s essay <i>Repressive Tolerance</i> stating:</span></p>

is similar to that of philosopher Karl Popper in so far as they both discuss
the necessity of intolerance of groups that advocate intolerance. However,
Haidt’s claim that Marcuse advocated for indoctrinating students is misleading.
Marcuse’s point is that educational institutions allow freedom of inquiry only
within a preestablished spectrum, as made evident by the numerous instances of
repression of left-leaning academics, and that the “Marcusean revolution”
should seek to redefine this preestablished spectrum in a way that is more
congruent with social justice and liberation for all oppressed people. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>This
might make one wonder how the question of education has been addressed by
scholars on the Left since the publication of Marcuse’s essay. Arguably the
most influential theory of pedagogy put forth by these scholars is that of
critical pedagogy. Two of the most influential theorists of critical pedagogy
are the scholars Henry Giroux and Peter McLaren, both of whom were highly
influenced by the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. Given that Peterson lists
the Education departments as one of the most corrupt in academia we may be
inclined to think the critical pedagogy of Giroux and McLaren seeks to
indoctrinate students with “postmodern” ways of thinking and censorship of
views on campus that they find offensive. However, what one finds is nothing of
the sort but rather a theory of education that emphasizes accountability and democracy.
Henry Giroux, writing in <i>Academic Repression,</i> showcases critical
pedagogy’s commitment to the defense of the modern university as a space of
free inquiry. He states: </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>“Higher
education has a deeper responsibility not only to search for the truth regardless
of where it may lead but also to educate students to make authority politically
and morally accountable; it is obliged to expand both academic freedom and the
possibility and promise of the university as a bastion of democratic inquiry,
values and politics, even as these are necessarily refashioned at the beginning
of the new millennium.”<sup>23</sup>  </span></p>

cannot advance within conditions of intimidation, self-censorship, constraint,

of freedom, respect, diversity, tolerance, and open dialogue and debate, in
contrast, knowledge grows and thrives. <i>Both</i> faculty and students must be
able to experiment with ideas, test them in concrete interaction with others,
unperturbed by artificially imposed ideological and political constraints…Thought
must be free to upset not only intellectual orthodoxy, but social and political
dogmas as well, and thus to be critical, controversial, radical, and shocking

Giroux or McLaren are simply indifferent to students’ experiences. In fact,
Giroux speaks to this in a lecture given in 2015.<sup>26</sup> All of this is
not to say that conservative academics don’t face discrimination in the university<sup>27</sup>
and it is undeniable that “PC culture” can and has gone too far in certain
instances on college campuses, in fact the authors of <i>Academic Repression</i>
list some in the introduction, but it’s attacks on academic freedom can find no
justification within Giroux’s critical pedagogy. It is astonishing that
Peterson has made no mention of Giroux or McLaren given the fact they are both
highly cited and influential scholars within the field of education and is
simply more evidence that he does not research the theories he criticizes. Nonetheless,
Giroux tells us that his critical pedagogy has as its main goal not just
teaching students to hold power and authority accountable and making them aware
of the conditions under which knowledge is produced but also to be able to
connect that knowledge to the democratization of the university and, more
broadly, society itself.<sup>28</sup></span></p>
